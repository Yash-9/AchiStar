# AchiStar
Problem Statement
I'm DevOps consultant in AchiStar Technologies. 
The company decided to implement DevOps to develop and deliver their products. 
Since it is an Agile organization, it follows Scrum methodology to develop the projects incrementally.
Here i'm working with multiple DevOps Engineers to build a Docker Jenkins Pipeline. 
During the sprint planning, we agreed on this project and plan to meet requirements, system configurations, and track the efficiency.

Task Done during project:-
1.Made available the application and its versions in the GitHub
2.Tracked their versions every time a code is committed to the repository
3.Created a Docker Jenkins Pipeline which created a Docker image from the Dockerfile and hosted it on Docker Hub
4.It pulled the Docker image and run as a Docker container
5.Builded the Docker Jenkins Pipeline to demonstrate the continuous integration and continuous delivery workflow
6.During the project goal was to deliver the product frequently to the production with high-end quality.
